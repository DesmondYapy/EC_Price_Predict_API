1. Feature Engineering Automation

Data Pipeline:
Utilize Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions to create a data pipeline that automates the data ingestion process from the URA API and any additional data sources. This pipeline will handle data retrieval, preprocessing, and storage in the PostgreSQL database.

Feature Generation:
Implement a feature engineering script that defines a set of transformations and calculations for deriving new features from the raw data. This script can be triggered by the data pipeline whenever new data is ingested.
Utilize libraries such as Featuretools or pandas to automate the generation of features based on specified rules and conditions.

2. Model Selection Automation

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):
Utilize AutoML libraries such as TPOT, Auto-sklearn, or H2O.ai to automate the model selection process. These libraries can evaluate multiple algorithms and hyperparameters, selecting the best-performing model based on predefined metrics (e.g., MAE, RÂ²).
Set up a pipeline to automatically retrain the model when new data is ingested, incorporating the latest features.

Cross-Validation:
Implement automated cross-validation strategies to assess model performance consistently. This ensures that the model selection process is robust and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Version Control:
Use tools like DVC (Data Version Control) to manage and version the datasets and models. This will allow tracking of changes and facilitate rollback if necessary.

3. Model Monitoring Automation

Monitoring Scripts:
Develop automated scripts to monitor key metrics (e.g., accuracy, MAE, latency) at regular intervals. These scripts can be run using cron job or triggered by events (e.g., new data ingestion).

Alert System:
Integrate an alerting mechanism using AWS CloudWatch to send notifications (e.g., via email or Slack) when monitoring metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

Dashboard Visualization:
Automate the updating of a monitoring dashboard (Grafana or CloudWatch Dashboards) that visualizes real-time metrics and logs.

Retraining Triggers:
Establish criteria for automatic retraining of the model based on monitoring results (e.g., significant model drift, drop in accuracy). Create a trigger in the pipeline that initiates the retraining process and updates the model in production.
